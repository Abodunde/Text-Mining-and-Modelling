# Document Overview
The Network Visualization file looks at the simple implementation of highlighting and the visualization of networking in a text file as well as files in a folder.
Using the example of inaugural speeches of US presidents, we visualize the connection between different the presidents and different NER-tagging entities. First we look at the connection between presidents, then we look relationship between presidents and Geopolitical entities.


Likewise, the Lexical Dispersion file looks at a simple implementation of lexical dipsersion over a period of time using the inaugural speech of US presidents. The lexical dispersion plot notes the occurrences of a word and how many words from the beginning of the corpus it appears (word offsets). This is particularly useful for a corpus that covers a longer time period and for which you want to analyse how specific terms were used more or less frequently over time.

Finally, we show a simple implementation of word frequency using WordCloud. We also demonstrate how to implement Frequency-related similarity. Frequency-related similarity refers to the concept of measuring the similarity or relatedness between two items based on their frequency of occurrence in a given context or dataset
Hope you find it insightful.
