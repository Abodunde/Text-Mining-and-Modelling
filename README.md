# Text-Modelling
This repository consists of three folders that explore different themes in Text Mining and Analytics.

The LSTM folder looks at different application of LSTM in real practice. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs in learning and retaining long-term dependencies in sequential data. LSTM networks are particularly effective in tasks involving sequential data, such as time series prediction, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Two ipynb files are present. "Basic LSTMs Language Modelling" explores at a basic level the creation of LSTM models. Likewise, we explore the possible use of LSTM for classification tasks in the "Using LSTM for Classification".ipynb file.

In Machine Learning with Text Data folder, we explore the use of Naive Bayes and Random forest for traditional classification tasks involving text data.

Finally, in Network Visualization, we explore different themes such as the concept and implementation of Lexical Dispersion and Frequency over time, visualizing word frequency using WordCloud as well as understanding at a deep level the concept of network visualization and highlighting. All of these themes were explored using the inaugural speech of all US presidents that is contained in the inaugural dataset of the NLTK library.
